There are **[Manual Build Instructions](https://github.com/cyanit/asana-desktop/blob/main/build%20instructions.md)** with an easy walktrough availible, in case you are new to node, npm and/or nativefier. They are basically the code and documentation in case you want to know whats actually in the binaries.
